# Introduction

This is a demo show-casing how to document a Python library with
[Sphinx] and [MyST], including the library's public API via drop-in
replacements for Sphinx's built-in [Autodoc] and [Autosummary]
extensions. It uses [Markdown] in its hand-written documents as well
as for the doc-strings embedded with the library code.

We want to see here how Sphinx+MyST stacks up against the Sphinx-only
approach: [demo-Sphinx-autodoc].
